<h1>Voice to Speech</h1>
<p> <b>Improve Your Voice to Improve Your Speech</b></p>
<p>Working on your voice is the only way to improve your speech.</p>
<p>Train yourself to adjust your body as you speak, be aware of unnecessary and inappropriate tension in the body that may impede your freedom of movement and that certainly reduce the range of tone and colour in your vocal sound.</p>
<p>Learn how to open yourself up to a full-bodied, generous vocal sound, first with the Mini Vocal Warmup, then extending it into the Vocal Maintenance and Advanced VoiceWork programs.</p>
<p>As your voice grows, you improve your clarity of speech by training the specific organs of articulation (lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates) to be flexible, powerful and agile.  </p>
<p>However, a well-balanced voice, or vocal sound is essential in the first place, to have a great range of vocal qualities and colours and tones available to be shaped into speech sounds.</p>
<p>A sound voice expressing clear speech requires an open, mobile, relaxed and alert person (i.e. body and mind) &#8212; not sitting hunched or cramped, and keeping your arms and hands free. It also requires clarity of thought. In other words, stand well, stay open, be present, know your subject, and care about it as you speak.</p>
