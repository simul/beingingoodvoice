<h1>How Voice Works</h1>
<p>A HEALTHY VOICE is created by air flowing — not pushed — between the vocal folds. The flow of air needs to be in the form of a consistent supply of air pressure in the lungs. The consistency of supply is enabled by the powerful muscles between the ribs, and by deep core muscles in the abdomen, working with the diaphragm.</p>
<p>Voice requires 4 elements:</p>
<p>1: A want, or a need to express yourself;</p>
<p>2: Air (breath) inside the body, providing air pressure beneath the vocal folds within the voice box (larynx);</p>
<p>3: Vocal folds drawn parallel to each other, touching, with just enough energy in them to require the air pressure below to puff them apart, causing sound waves (primary tone). Vocal pitch&#42; is decided here, depending on the length and thickness of the vocal folds.</p>
<p>4: Different spaces and substances of the body to provide resonance&#42;&#42;. Yet more sound waves are created in various spaces such as the throat, mouth, sinus and nasal cavities, the chest, bones of the head etc. These secondary tones are deeper or lighter, depending on the size of the cavity and the size of the opening to that cavity, and this is called Resonance**.</p>
<p> It is the combination of vocal pitch and resonant pitch that make up the sound of the voice. Because everyone is built slightly differently, every voice is unique.</p>
<p>When you speak, sound vibrates throughout your body. Whatever your body is doing affects how you sound. The more vibrations you create, the more easily they are conducted through your body, the more voice you have.</p>
<p>Sound waves are conducted well by less dense substances. Air, for example, is a great conductor or sound. Wood is pretty good too. But concrete is not.</p>
<p>The human body is made up of a huge variety of substances, and some of them better conductors of sound than others.</p>
<p>Bone is a good conductor, but tensely constricted muscle is very bad. Floppy muscles are not very good conductors, but engaged muscles are. The more flexible your muscles are, the more space they can create inside your body, and the more full-bodied you will sound. So it is important to understand, and to be responsible for what is going on inside your body.</p>
<p>Tense, or constricted muscles not only limit the vibrations that you can create, and therefore share, they also limit the amount of space you can create in your body. For example, a tense, tight jaw keeps your mouth cavity small, and stops your sound vibrations from flowing freely out into the room to be shared with your listeners.</p>
<p>Tight shoulders, neck and abdomen all contribute to limiting the volume and the quality of the sound.</p>
<p>Your spinal column needs to flow up through the centre of your back in its natural curves — but not overly curved — so that your rib cage has maximum potential for movement as your lungs expand and contract, and so that your core muscles have optimum room for manoeuvrability.</p>
<p>&#42; Vocal pitch means how high, or low (especially in singing, but also in the tune, or intonation of your voice). Think of how your voice gets higher when you are excited, or lower if you are unhappy.</p>
<p>&#42;&#42; Resonance determines the colour, or quality of your voice. Think of a rich, dark, chocolaty voice, or a fine, bright, silvery voice. You can have them both, or any colour or quality in between.</p>

How Speech Works
Speech requires 5 elements:
1 to 4 from How Voice Works
PLUS
5: An agile, flexible set of articulators (lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates) to shape the vocal sound into speech sounds (phonemes) that combine into words that are combined into phrases, sentences, paragraphs.
Clear, articulate SPEECH occurs when the changing shapes inside the mouth and throat shape the VOICE into clearly differentiated speech sounds. These changing shapes are caused as the mouth opens due to movement of the lower jaw, or the lips change shape or position, or the tongue moves into different positions within the mouth, in close or distant proximity to the teeth, the teeth ridges, the hard or soft palate, or the soft palate itself moves higher or lower. These movements happen in a range of combinations, allowing for a huge range of speech sounds.
Speech sounds are defined as either VOWELS or CONSONANTS. When we talk about vowels and consonants with reference to speech sounds, we are not talking about letters of the alphabet.
Think about it this way: The letter "A" helps us to spell a word such as "at". It also helps to spell the word "mane". The sounds represented by the letter "a" in these words are completely different sounds.
So when we use the term vowel in voice and speech work, we are not talking about a letter of the alphabet. A vowel is defined as a speech sound shaped in the mouth by the articulators, during which the outgoing air is not stopped, re-directed, or interfered with in any way.
A consonant is a speech sound shaped in the mouth by the articulators, during which the outgoing air is either stopped, or redirected, or interfered with in some way.
Voice Matters
Working on your voice is the only way to improve your speech.
Train yourself to adjust your body as you speak, be aware of unnecessary and inappropriate tension in the body that may impede your freedom of movement and that certainly reduces the range of tone and colour in your vocal sound.
Build yourself up to a full-bodied, generous vocal sound, first with the Mini Vocal Warmup, then extending it into the Vocal Maintenance program.
As your voice grows, you improve your clarity of speech by training the specific organs of articulation (lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates) to be flexible, powerful and agile. 
 However, a well-balanced voice, or vocal sound is essential in the first place, to have a great range of vocal qualities, colours and tones available to be shaped into speech sounds.
A sound, healthy full-bodied voice expressing clear speech requires an open, mobile, relaxed and alert person (i.e. body and mind) — not sitting hunched or cramped, and keeping your arms and hands free. It also requires clarity of thought. In other words - 
stand well, 
stay open, 
be present, 
know your subject, and 
care about it as you speak..
