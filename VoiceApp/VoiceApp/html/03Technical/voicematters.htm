<h1>Why Voice Matters</h1>

Working on your voice is the only way to improve your speech.
Train yourself to adjust your body as you speak, be aware of unnecessary and inappropriate tension in the body that may impede your freedom of movement and that certainly reduces the range of tone and colour in your vocal sound.
Build yourself up to a full-bodied, generous vocal sound, first with the Mini Vocal Warmup, then extending it into the Vocal Maintenance program.
As your voice grows, you improve your clarity of speech by training the specific organs of articulation (lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates) to be flexible, powerful and agile. 
 However, a well-balanced voice, or vocal sound is essential in the first place, to have a great range of vocal qualities, colours and tones available to be shaped into speech sounds.
A sound, healthy full-bodied voice expressing clear speech requires an open, mobile, relaxed and alert person (i.e. body and mind) â€” not sitting hunched or cramped, and keeping your arms and hands free. It also requires clarity of thought. In other words - 
stand well, 
stay open, 
be present, 
know your subject, and 
care about it as you speak..
