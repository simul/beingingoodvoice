<h1>How Speech Works</h1>
<p> Speech requires 5 elements: </p>
<p> 1 to 4 from How Voice Works  </p>
<p> PLUS  </p>
<p> 5:	An agile, flexible set of articulators (lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates) to shape the vocal sound into speech sounds (phonemes) that combine into words that are combined into phrases, sentences, paragraphs.</p>
<p> Clear, articulate SPEECH occurs when the changing shapes inside the mouth and throat shape the VOICE into clearly differentiated speech sounds. These changing shapes are caused as the mouth opens due to movement of the lower jaw, or the lips change shape or position, or the tongue moves into different positions within the mouth, in close or distant proximity to the teeth, the teeth ridges, the hard or soft palate, or the soft palate itself moves higher or lower.  These movements happen in a range of combinations, allowing for a huge range of speech sounds. </p>
 </p>Speech sounds are defined as either VOWELS or CONSONANTS.  When we talk about vowels and consonants with reference to speech sounds, we are not talking about letters of the alphabet.</p>
 <p>Think about it this way: The letter &#34;A&#34; helps us to spell a word such as &#34;at&#34;.  It also helps to spell the word &#34;mane&#34;.  The sounds represented by the letter &#34;a&#34; in these words are completely different sounds.</p>
<p> So when we use the term vowel in voice and speech work, we are not talking about a letter of the alphabet. A vowel is defined as a speech sound shaped in the mouth by the articulators, during which the outgoing air is not stopped, re-directed, or interfered with in any way.</p>
<p> A consonant is a speech sound shaped in the mouth by the articulators, during which the outgoing air is either stopped, or redirected, or interfered with in some way.</p>
