<h1>How Voice Works</h1>
<p>A HEALTHY VOICE is created by air flowing — not pushed — between the vocal folds. The flow of air needs to be in the form of a consistent supply of air pressure in the lungs. The consistency of supply is enabled by the powerful muscles between the ribs, and by deep core muscles in the abdomen, working with the diaphragm.</p>
<p>Voice requires 4 elements:</p>
<p>1: A want, or a need to express yourself, or to communicate with someone;</p>
<p>2: Air (breath) inside the body, providing air pressure beneath the vocal folds within the voice box (larynx);</p>
<p>3: Vocal folds drawn parallel to each other, touching, with just enough energy in them to require the air pressure below to puff them apart, causing sound waves (primary tone). Vocal pitch&#42; is decided here, depending on the length and thickness of the vocal folds.</p>
<p>4: Different spaces in the body, and the different substances that constitute the body (bone, muscle, organs, fluids etc.) to provide resonance&#42;&#42;. Yet more sound waves are created in various spaces such as the throat, mouth, sinus and nasal cavities, the chest, bones of the head etc. These secondary tones are deeper or lighter, depending on the size of the cavity and the size of the opening to that cavity, and this is called Resonance**.</p>
<p> It is the combination of vocal pitch and resonant pitch that make up the sound of the voice. Because everyone is built slightly differently, every voice is unique.</p>
<p>When you speak, sound vibrates throughout your body. Whatever your body is doing affects how you sound. The more vibrations you create, the more easily they are conducted through your body, the more voice you have.</p>
<p>Sound waves are conducted well by less dense substances. Air, for example, is a great conductor or sound. Wood is pretty good too. But concrete is not.</p>
<p>The human body is made up of a huge variety of substances, and some of them better conductors of sound than others.</p>
<p>Bone is a good conductor, but tensely constricted muscle is very bad. Floppy muscles are not very good conductors, but engaged muscles are. The more flexible your muscles are, the more space they can create inside your body, and the more full-bodied you will sound. So it is important to understand, and to be responsible for what is going on inside your body.</p>
<p>Tense, or constricted muscles not only limit the vibrations that you can create, and therefore share, they also limit the amount of space you can create in your body. For example, a tense, tight jaw keeps your mouth cavity small, and stops your sound vibrations from flowing freely out into the room to be shared with your listeners.</p>
<p>Tight shoulders, neck and abdomen all contribute to limiting the volume and the quality of the sound.</p>
<p>Your spinal column needs to flow up through the centre of your back in its natural curves — but not overly curved — so that your rib cage has maximum potential for movement as your lungs expand and contract, and so that your core muscles have optimum room for manoeuvrability.</p>
<p>&#42; Vocal pitch means how high, or low (especially in singing, but also in the tune, or intonation of your voice). Think of how your voice gets higher when you are excited, or lower if you are unhappy.</p>
<p>&#42;&#42; Resonance determines the colour, or quality of your voice. Think of a rich, dark, chocolaty voice, or a fine, bright, silvery voice. You can have them both, or any colour or quality in between.</p>
