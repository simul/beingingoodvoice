<p>Give your sigh a little more vocal energy, so that it now sounds more like &#39;AH&#39;, but still very gently.</p>
<p>This continues the process of stimulating blood flow to the whole of the larynx.</p>
<p>It also requires more breath energy, so be vigilant in observing the easy, fast, silent inflow of air as you prepare to sigh it out on an &#39;AH&#39; sound.</p>
