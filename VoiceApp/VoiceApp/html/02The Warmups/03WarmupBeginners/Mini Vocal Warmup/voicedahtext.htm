<h1>Voiced AH</h1>

<p>Finally, check your posture and your relaxed, open jaw.
<p>Keep your mouth and throat open and relaxed (2 fingertips) to allow the breath to flow in, and then out on an AH sound.</p>
<p>&bull; Say AH on an easy pitch somewhere in the middle of your normal speaking range,</p> 
<p>&bull; sustain that same pitch for a couple of beats,</p>
<p>&bull; then slide down in pitch until it is somewhere low, but still easy to sustain.</p>
<p>&bull; Stay on the final note for a beat or two. 
<p>&bull; Finish making the sound, but keep your jaw fully released, and your mouth open for another couple of beats.</p>
<p> Your <b>goal, with practice,</b> is to create a fully voiced AH that sounds as good at the end as it did at the beginning. It begins open, and is still open at the end. There is no pushing to get started, and no cutting off to complete.</p>

<p>That's it!  You have now completed the Mini Vocal Warmup.</p>
