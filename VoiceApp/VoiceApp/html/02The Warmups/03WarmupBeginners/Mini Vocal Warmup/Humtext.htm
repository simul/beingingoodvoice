<p>Continue to warm up your voice by humming gently, and smoothly.</p>

<p>&bull; Release, and drop your jaw,</p>
<p>&bull; allow some breath in silently, easily and quickly, </p>
<p>&bull; bring your lips together gently, with no tensing of lip or facial muscles.</p>
<p></p>  
<p>Have that innocent look on your face that says &ldquo;Who me? I'm not doing anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&bull;Start humming in the middle of your range and slide up and down in pitch, a little higher and a little lower each time.</p>
<p>Do two or three circles, and allow fresh breath in whenever you feel like it. 
<p> 
<div style="width:600px;height:500px;border:2px solid blue;">
Remember to allow the breath in silently and quickly.</p>
<p> Catch yourself in the moment of gasping, or reaching for the air, observe the action, and let it go.</p>
<p>The more you notice these things, the more ability you have to choose how you want to do it.</p>
</div>
<p>&bull; Think of the sound as going round in a circle, flowing outwards from your centre in a continuous smooth movement.</p>
<p>Be easy, play with the sound. If your voice cracks and wobbles your challenge is to <b>eventually</b> do it smoothly. It takes practice and time for the vocal muscles to become strong and flexible.</p>
<p>There is no need to go as high or as low as you can possibly go, at this stage.  This is a warmup, not training.</p>
