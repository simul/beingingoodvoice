<h1>Finish with Focus</h1>

To conclude your warmup, here are two exercises from the Russian style of voice training. They will keep you focussed, energised and ready to undertake whatever vocal challenges the day brings you. 
<p> The MAH exercise begins with a hum, opens into the AH sound, and floats freely away into the room.</p>
<p>&bull; Establish a steady, consistent rhythm </p>
<p>&bull; Vary the length of each sound from time to time </p>
<p>&bull; Discover the sound in your centre, and send it out into the room to a specific point in space, or on a wall</p>
<p>&bull; Check your posture, and move freely around the room, finding new objects to share your sound with.</p>
<p></p>
<p><center><b>Mah</b></p>
<p>MMMAH MMMAH MMMAH MMMAH</p>
<p>NNNAH NNNAH NNNAH NNNAH</p>
<p>RRRRAH RRRAH RRRAH RRRAH</p>
<p>SSSAH SSSAH SSSAH SSSAH</p>
<p>SHAH SHAH SHAH SHAH</p>
<p> SHSHSHSHSHSHSHSHSH (to the end of the breath)</center></p>
</p>
<p> SEA MOON sets up a swaying motion in the body, but with the sound always coming from the centre of the body.</p>
<p>&bull; Establish a steady rhythm</p>
<p>&bull; Don't try to go to the end of the breath, except on the MN MN line. </p>
<p>&bull; Allow breath (always!) to drop into the body easily, silently, quickly, whenever you need it.</p> 
<p>&bull; Visualise the Sea out to your right, the Moon rising to your left, and use your arms to indicate the size and distance of your vision </p>
