<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Being in Voice is a unique training program devised by Flloyd Kennedy to produce a vibrant and fully embodied voice for performance, allowing you to express yourself freely, comfortably and confidently.</p>
<p>The program is suitable for anyone who wishes to develop a strong, flexible, effective speaking voice.</p>
<p>For actors, this means being alive and working in the moment, keeping the presentation or the performance fresh and spontaneous every time.</p>
<p>For all professional public speakers, performers, broadcasters and voice over artists, it is essential to prepare well in advance, giving yourself &#8212; and your muscles, time to be fit, flexible and truly responsive to the demands of the occasion.<p>
<p>Whether you are making a 5 minute pitch or performing Hamlet, your voice connects you, physically, to your audience.</p>
<p>You are your voice, so make the most of it!</p>
<p>Being in Voice offers a range of programs to suit all levels of experience, and it is designed individually to accommodate your busy schedule.</p>
<p>Being in Voice is based in Brisbane, Qld, Australia. Also available for online coaching via Skype.</p>
