<h1>Rolling Down the Spine</h1>


<p> Before you begin to Roll Down the Spine, check that your weight is evenly distributed over both feet, your arms are loosely hanging from your shoulders, legs straight but not locked.</p>
<p><center> Listen as Flloyd talks you through
the roll down process.

<p>&#8226; Release your head first, allowing it to float gently down till your chin nearly touches your chest</p>
<p>&#8226; Allow your shoulders to slump forwards, following  the head, and gently float down until
you are hanging upside down, your spine completely curved with the weight of your head, arms and upper body falling, completely relaxed, towards the floor</p>
<p>&#8226; Initiate the Roll Up movement in your core. You do this by drawing your belly button gently in towards the small of your back, and noticing that your spine begins to unroll itself from the tailbone up.</p>
<p>&#8226; Allow your shoulders to fall into place as you return to the upright position.</p>
<p>&#8226; Make sure your head is the last thing to return to upright.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8226; If you have arrived back in the upright position with hair across your face,
resist the temptation to shake your head. Instead, brush it gently back with your hands, and return your hands to their relaxed position at your sides.</p>
<p>&#8226; Observe how your body feels now, and how you feel about it. Again, there is no &#39;right&#39; or &#39;wrong&#39;. The important part of the exercises is your awareness of what you actually notice, and what is actually there.</p>
<p> &#8226; Move around the room, and observe how easily, or with what degree of difficulty, you maintain any sensation of lightness, freedom of movement &#8212; or not! &#8212; as you go. Stop and do the Roll Down whenever you want to find it again.</p>
<p> If you do this a couple of times a day for a few weeks, you will gradually accustom yourself WITH AWARENESS to the physical sensation, from inside your body, of standing well. You can then take this feeling with you as you walk, sit, run, lie down, jump around, dance &#8212; in other words, live your life. It will become easier to engage your body in this powerful, well-supported, actively mobile position to begin your vocal work, and to carry it with you into your professional life. </p>
