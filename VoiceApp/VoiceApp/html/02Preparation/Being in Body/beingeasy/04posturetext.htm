<h1>Posture</h1>

<p>Stand, preferably bare foot, and notice the sensation of your weight through your feet in contact with the floor.</p>

<p><center>Play the audio, as Flloyd talks you through the alignment process.</center></p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; Allow your arms to flow softly down at your sides from your shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8226; Soften your knees, and notice how that requires soft ankles, and soft pelvic
joint.</p>
<p>&#8226; Float your tailbone gently forward a tiny amount, about a centimetre, and
allow your pelvic structure to tilt gently upwards in a forward direction. Some people call this &#34;tilting the pelvis&#34;, other call it &#34;tucking the tail under&#34;. It is a Very Slight Movement!</p>
<p>&#8226; Imagine, or visualise your spinal column flowing upwards from your tailbone in its natural curves in at the small of your back, out around the rib cage, in at the neck area and then up into your skull.</p>
<p>&#8226; Observe your rib cage springing out and around to the front of your chest, your shoulder blades hanging loosely down your back, your head floating freely above your neck. Look straight ahead.</p>
<p>&#8226; Imagine, or visualise one hair in the centre of the top of your head being gently tugged up towards the sky, and allow your body to rise up in response. This is a tiny, subtle yet profound movement, you feel as if you have grown a centimetre or so.</p>
<p>&#8226; Notice, or give attention to how your body feels in this position. There is no &#39;right&#39; or &#39;wrong&#39; response, just awareness.</p>

<p><center>Now you're ready for Rolling Down the spine. </center></p>
