<h1>Move Easy</h1>

<p> This is a basic Rolling Down the Spine exercise, but with particular elements built in to help you become mindful of your physical state.
Before you begin check that your weight is evenly distributed over both feet, your arms are loosely hanging from your shoulders, legs straight but not locked, jaw relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8226; Observe how your body feels before you begin and  you finish, and how you feel about it.</p>
<p>&#8226; There is no &#39;right&#39; or &#39;wrong&#39;. 
<p>&#8226; The important part of the exercises is your awareness of what you actually notice, and recognition of what is actually there.</p>
<p> &#8226; Move around the room, and observe how easily, or with what degree of difficulty, you maintain any sensation of lightness, freedom of movement &#8212; or not! &#8212; as you go.</p>
<p> &#8226; Repeat the Move Easy (Rolling Down) whenever you want to find that ease of movement again.</p>
<p> If you do this a couple of times a day for a few weeks, you will gradually accustom yourself WITH AWARENESS to the physical sensation, from inside your body, of standing well. You can then take this feeling with you as you walk, sit, run, lie down, jump around, dance &#8212; in other words, live your life. It will become easier to engage your body in this powerful, well-supported, actively mobile position to begin your vocal work, and to carry it with you into your professional life. </p>
