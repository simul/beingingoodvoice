<h1>Before You Make a Sound</h1>
<p><b>Before you begin to warm up your voice, warm up your whole body. Bounce gently on your feet, hop, move your arms, jog or dance about for a minute or two.</b></p>
<p>Use the Stand Easy and Move Easy exercises to get used to balancing your whole body in relation to gravity, so that you stand, sit and move with ease.</p>
	<p>When you stand with ease, you can move with ease and speak with ease. Being aware of your physical state puts you in control of it.</p>
