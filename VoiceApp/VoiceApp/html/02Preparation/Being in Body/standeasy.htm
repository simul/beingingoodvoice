<h1>Stand Easy</h1>

<p>Stand, preferably bare foot, and notice the sensation of your weight through your feet in contact with the floor.</p>
</p>
<p>&#8226; Notice, or give attention to how your body feels before you start, and when you finish.</p>
<p>&#8226; There is no &#39;right&#39; or &#39;wrong&#39; response, just awareness. 
<p>&#8226; Whatever you observe is interesting.</p>

<p><center>Now you're ready to Move Easily. </center></p>
