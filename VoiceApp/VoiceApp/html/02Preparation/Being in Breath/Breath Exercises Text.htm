<h1>Breath Exercises</h1>
<p>&#8226; Relax your jaw: Drop the mouth open till 2 fingertips can be placed, one on top of the other, between the front teeth.</p> 
<p>&#8226; Allow a silent, quick breath in through your mouth... wait... allow it out... wait.</p> 
<p>&#8226; Repeat several times, noticing how easy it is, how you don&#39;t need a lot of air to go in each time, and how the air goes in and comes out silently through an open throat  (If your throat gets dry, swallow and refresh it any time you like!)</p>
<p>&#8226; Notice if your jaw quietly closes itself, without your noticing. Encourage it to stay open, massage the area around the joint, between your cheek bones and your ears, always gently and kindly.</p>
    <p>Prepare for your breath work with a relaxed, released loose lower jaw. </p>
     <p>Be kind to your jaw. Itâ€™s been working hard all your life to keep you safe behind its guardrail. Give it a break. Send it to the Bahamas for a rest.  It will thank you for it, eventually.</p>
<p>When your jaw is released, you are able to create more space in the mouth, which allows for a more resonant sound, and it also provides more room for the tongue to be more flexible, and agile.  A relaxed jaw means relaxed facial, mouth and throat muscles, including the lips and the soft palate, so that they will be in a better position to allow for more accurate placement of the combinations of lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates. Your vocal sound will vibrate more freely via a relaxed jaw, and you will have more volume, for no extra effort.</p></p>
<p>Release the jaw by actually letting it go, letting it drop down until you can slip 2 fingertips between your teeth without straining. This takes time and practice and patience.</p>
<p>&#8226; Now, allow a little breath in through your open mouth and throat, silently &#8212; wait &#8212; allow it back out(silently) &#8212; wait. (repeat 4 times)</p>
<p>[Notice how open your throat is, without any effort involved. The more relaxed your jaw becomes, the easier it is to open the throat].</p>
<p>Notice how the air goes in and comes out easily through the open throat]
<p>&#8226; Allow a quick, silent breath in &#8212; wait &#8212; keep throat open as you gently allow breath to flow out through the open throat for 4 beats. Repeat 4 times</p>
<p>&#8226; Allow a quick, silent breath in &#8212; wait &#8212;vocalize the breath for 4 beats at it flows back out. The sound you will make is the central vowel, the schwa, almost like &#39;er&#39; but even more floppy and relaxed. (repeat 4 times).</p>
<p>Repeat several times, noticing how easy it is, how you don't need a lot of air to go in each time, and how the air goes in and comes out silently through an open throat.  (If your throat gets dry, swallow and refresh it any time you like)</p>
<p>This exercise is help you recreate the circumstances of your natural, autonomous (unconscious) breathing process, but in a state of awareness (mindfulness) so that you can build on it.</p> 
Check your posture, check your jaw (two fingertips space between your front teeth), slip your tongue tip out of your mouth and leave it resting on the outside of your bottom lip.</p>
<p>Repeat the breath exercises, as far as you can, while aiming the tip of your tongue further and further down towards your chin. The more relaxed your jaw, the further out your tongue will slide. It's a great stretch, and starts the process of releasing tension at the back, and the root of your tongue. This will give you greater flexibility when you come to work on speech sounds, and words generally.</p>
<p>&#8226; Next, allow that quick, silent breath in &#8212; wait &#8212; but this time make an SSS sound as the air flows out. Hold the SSS for 4 beats. Relax. and Repeat 4 times.</p>
<p>&#8226; Do the same, but this time make a ZZZZ sound for 4 beats. Repeat 4 times.
<p>Notice that you are now making sounds that occur in speech. Breath and Voice are as one.
<p>
</p>Practise Being in Your Breath until you are comfortable that your breath flows easily, your shoulders and upper chest stay free and relaxed, and your lower abdominal muscles are the ones supporting your voice.</p>
<p> You can extend these little sequences to challenge your breathing support muscles to work harder, but aiming for 8 seconds, or 12 seconds.  Take it easy. Build up the strength gradually, just as you would at the gym. You wouldn't try to emulate a professional body builder unless you'd worked your way up to it.
<p></p>
<p>Now you are ready to convert all of that breath into sound. It is called &#8212 The Sigh, and it is the first exercise in the Mini Vocal Warmup.
