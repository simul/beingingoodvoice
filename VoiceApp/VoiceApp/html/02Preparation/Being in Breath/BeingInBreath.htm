<h1>Being in Breath</h1>

<p>This process helps you recreate the circumstances of your natural, autonomous (unconscious) breathing process, but in a state of awareness (mindfulness) so that you can build on it.</p> 
<p>It will feel artificial at first, because it is different to the way we breathe in when we are conscious (aware) of breathing in.</p>
<p>By learning how to ALLOW the breath to DROP into the bottom of the lungs, we learn how to recreate the circumstances of normal breathing, but with awareness. Then we can work with the appropriate muscles to build their power and flexibility so that we can access a powerful, consistent supply of air pressure when we need it for powerful moments of expression.</p>
