<h1>Fast Ascending Trill</h1>

<p>Can you blow bubbles through your lips? Brrrrrr! Or make a trilled R sound Rrrrrrr (like a Scottish, or Italian Rrrrrr)?</p>

<p>If you struggle with either of these, don&#39;t panic! You can learn how to do them. It just takes time, and patience.</p>
<p> The important thing to remember is that everyone CAN do them, but some people have to work at it.</p>
<p> You can slide up and down on a hum for your warmup, while you continue to practice blowing those bubbles, and rolling (or trilling) those rrrr&#39;s.</p>
<p>Begin low-ish in your range (no strain) and slide quite quickly up in pitch to somewhere high-ish (without straining).  Remember, this is a warmup, not training.</p>
<p> Trill from low to high two or three times, beginning a little lower, and finishing a little higher each time.</p>
<p> Remember to allow the breath in softly, easily and silently each time.</p>
<p> As you become more comfortable with the trill over time, make it last longer, i.e. take more time to get from low to high, and enjoy the journey.</p>
