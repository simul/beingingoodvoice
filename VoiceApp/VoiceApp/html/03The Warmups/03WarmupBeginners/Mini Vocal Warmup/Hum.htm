<title>The Hum</title>
</head>
<p>Continue to warm up your voice by humming gently, and smoothly.</p>
<p>&bull;Think of the sound as going round in a circle, flowing outwards from your centre in a continuous smooth movement.</p>
<p>&bull;Be easy, play with the sound. If your voice cracks and wobbles your challenge is to <b>eventually</b> do it smoothly. It takes practice and time for the vocal muscles to become strong and flexible.</p>
<p>&bull;There is no need to go as high or as low as you can possibly go, at this stage.  This is a warmup, not training. You do want to challenge yourself to a certain extent, to take it a little bit higher, and a little bit lower each time. However, it should NEVER be painful.</p>
