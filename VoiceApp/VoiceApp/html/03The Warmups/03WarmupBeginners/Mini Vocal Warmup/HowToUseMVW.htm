<h1>How to Use the Mini Vocal Warmup</h1>

<p>First, practice all the exercises individually in sequence: Sigh, Sighing Ah, Hum, Ascending Trill, Descending Trill and Voiced Ah.</p>
<p>&#8226; Repeat each of the exercises at least 3 times.</p>
<p>&#8226;Once you have learned the sequence, repeat it whenever you feel like it.</p>
<p>&#8226;First thing in the morning is good. So is last thing at night. Under the shower, walking to the bus, doing the dishes &#8212; any time you think of it. </p>
<p>You can also do the exercises individually. Sighing and humming will keep your vocal folds warm and flexible during the day.</p>
<p>These exercises form the foundation for a more strenuous warmup and as the basis of a training program.</p>
<p>As long as you pay attention to your posture, release the jaw and allow your breath to flow with ease, you can begin to extend the exercises, making them last longer, and stretching higher and lower in your pitch range.</p> 
</p>When you are proficient in The Mini Vocal Warmup, you are ready for the Vocal Maintenance Program.</p>
