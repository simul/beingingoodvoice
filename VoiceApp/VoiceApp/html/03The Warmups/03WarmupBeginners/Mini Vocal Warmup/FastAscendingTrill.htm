<h1>Fast Ascending Trill</h1>

<p>Can you blow bubbles through your lips? Brrrrrr. Or make a trilled R sound Rrrrrrr (like a Scottish, or Italian Rrrrrr)?</p>
<p>&bull; Begin low-ish in your range (no strain) and slide quite quickly up in pitch to somewhere high-ish (without straining).  Allow the sound to float away freely as soon as you get to the squeak.</p>
<p>&bull; Trill from low to high two or three times, beginning a little lower, and finishing a little higher each time.</p>
<p>&bull; Allow the breath in softly, easily and silently each time.</p>
<p> As you become more comfortable with the trill over time, make it last longer, i.e. take more time to get from low to high, and enjoy the journey.</p>
<p>Stay in your easy pitch range, you do not need to be as high, or as low as I am, or you might be higher or lower. Whatever it is, it is interesting.</p>
