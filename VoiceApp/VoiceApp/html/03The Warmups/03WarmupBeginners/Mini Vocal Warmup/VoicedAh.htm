<h1>Voiced AH</h1>

<p>Finally, check your posture and your relaxed, open jaw.
<p>Say AH, but this time using your full voice, supported by an easy breath, flowing from the middle of your range to an easy, sustained low note over 6 to 8 seconds.</p>
<p>&bull; As you finish making the sound, leave your jaw fully released, and your mouth open for another couple of seconds.</p>
<p>&bull; Listen to the quality of the silence you are creating.</p>
<p> Your <b>goal, with practice,</b> is to create a fully voiced AH that sounds as good at the end as it did at the beginning. It begins open, and is still open at the end. There is no pushing to get started, and no cutting off to complete.</p>

<p>That's it!  You have now completed the Mini Vocal Warmup.</p>
<p>When you are comfortable that you understand what is involved in each of the elements, you are ready to do the Complete Mini Vocal Warmup with Flloyd.</p>
