<h1>The Sigh</h1>


<p>Sighing gently is a great way to release physical tension, and to stimulate blood flow to the vocal folds, literally warming them up.</p>
<p> We sigh: </p>
<p> &#8212; when we want something, or when we give up on it, </p>
<p> &#8212; because we are annoyed, or because we are pleased.</p>
<p> Always begin to warm up your voice with a few gentle sighs.</p>
<p> A sigh is just air passing through partly closed vocal folds, creating a mixture of friction and vocal sound. But it is also part of our vocal vocabulary. It means something.</p> 
<p> Let each sigh mean whatever it means, just as you experience it, and then let it go. There are always plenty more where that one came from.</p>
