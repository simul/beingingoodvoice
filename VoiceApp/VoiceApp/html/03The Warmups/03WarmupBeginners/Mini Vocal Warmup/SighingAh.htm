<h1>Sighing "AH"</h1>

<p>Give your sigh a little more vocal energy, so that it now sounds more like a spoken &#39;AH&#39;, but still very gently.</p>
<p>Allow the sound to flow naturally from the middle of your range, where it is easy, down to somewhere low, where it is still easy, and then let it go freely.</p>
<p>This continues the process of stimulating blood flow to the whole of the larynx.</p>
<p>It also requires more breath energy, so be vigilant in observing the easy, fast, silent inflow of air as you prepare to sigh it out on an &#39;AH&#39; sound.</p>
<p>You are aiming for a slightly breathy sound, loud enough to be heard a few metres away, with no force or pushing, just a gentle Ah...</p>
