<h1>Articulation</h1>

<p> Begin by checking your posture, and releasing your jaw and tongue. </p>
<p> Do some tongue stretches, taking the tip down to your chin, and up to your nose, round your teeth (inside the mouth) and pointing it into the sides of your cheeks, one side and then the other.</p>
<p> The favourite diction exercise of actors is the repetition of the unvoiced consonants P T K and their voiced partners B D G.</p>
<p> These are significant because they are created at the front of the mouth (P and B with the lips), the centre (T and D with the tongue tip behind the top teeth) and the back of the mouth (K and G with the back of the tongue touching the soft palate).</p>
<p> Practise them in sequence, slowly at first, building up speed with accuracy.</p>

<p> Tongue Twisters are excellent Exercises for developing clear articulate speech.</p>
<p> &bull;  Avoid OVER pronouncing. Use the least muscular effort necessary to give a clear sound.</p>
<p> &bull;  Begin slowly, memorising the text by concentrating on what you are saying, and thinking about what you are saying.</p>
<p> &bull;  Speed up gradually, go only as fast as you can with accuracy,</p>
<p> &bull;  Avoid doing these merely as a technical exercise.  You will get more benefit if you are mindful of what the words mean, as well as what the sounds are.</p>
<p> Here are a couple of tongue twisters. You will find many, many more on the internet.
