<h1>Vocal Maintenance Program</h1>
<p>This program is a more advanced level of the exercises you have been working with in the Mini Vocal Warmup. It is a scientifically tested sequence of exercises&#42; designed to keep your voice box (larynx) healthy, building muscle tone and breath control at a steady pace.</p> 
<p> &bull; Listen to the audio, and learn the sequence.
<p> &bull; Each element is done twice, then the whole sequence is repeated.  As you become more proficient over time, and notice your development beginning to plateau, add in more repeats.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Preparation:</b>
<p>&bull; Do some stretches, and something aerobic like jogging on the spot, or dancing about, for a minute or two, to get the blood flow going through your muscles.</p>  
<p>&bull; Do the STAND Easy exercise, and the MOVE EASY (ROLL DOWN).</p>
<p>&bull; Stand with feet hip width apart, your weight evenly distributed over both feet, soft ankles, soft knees, soft pelvis; lower your centre of gravity by bending knees slightly, tuck the tailbone under (or slide it forwards in space slightly) to tilt the pelvis up at the front, just enough to level it out, i.e. about &#189; centimetre.</p>
<p>1 Sustain a SSSSS for as long as possible, relax and repeat immediately</p>
<p>2 Sustain a ZZZZZ for as long as possible, relax and repeat immediately</p>
<p>			<center>Goal: S and Z same length&#42;&#42;</p>
<p>			Males: professional voice users aim to achieve 45-50 secs (on average) eventually.</p>
<p>			Females: professional voice users aim to achieve 40-45 secs (on average) eventually.</center></p>
<p>If you add <b>one second</b> on average, every two or three days, you will be doing really well!</p>
<p>3 (stretching the vocal folds) Glide from your lowest note to your highest note on the tongue trill RRRR, or lip trill BRBRBRBR, or lip-buzzing BM (OO with lips halfway between B and M). </p>
<p>&bull; Do it slowly.</p> 
<p>&bull; Do it as slowly as possible. </p>
<p>&bull; Don&#146;t try to hold the top note.</p> 
<p>&bull; Allow your sound to crack and wobble, if that&#146;s what happens, and make sure to keep going all the way without stopping, no matter what it sounds like.</p>  
<p>&bull; Keep it EASY!  The aim is for it to eventually be smooth all the way, but that takes time and practice.</p>
<p> Repeat.</p>
			<p><center>Goal: no voice breaks, cracks or wobbles&#42;&#42;</center>
<p>4 (contracting the vocal folds)  Glide from a comfortable high note to your lowest note on the tongue trill or lip trill or BM as above.</p>
<p>&bull; Do it slowly.</p> 
<p>&bull; Do it as slowly as possible. </p>
<p>&bull; Don&#146;t try to hold the top note.</p> 
<p><center>	Goal = no voice breaks, cracks or wobbles</center></p> 	
<p>5 (power) Sustain a 5 note scale in the middle of your range for as long as possible on the vowel AW (as in paw).</p>
<p> Repeat.</p>
		<p><center>Goal: 35 - 40 secs for females</p>
			<p>	40 - 50 secs for males&#42;&#42;</center></p>
<p>6 Voiced AH: Slide down your range from middle of the voice to low on an open (2 fingertips between teeth) AH. Begin with open mouth, open throat, relaxed jaw, tip of the tongue resting behind the bottom teeth.</p> 
			<p> Repeat.</p>
		<p><center>	Goal: smooth, clear, open, healthy sounding all the way. Aim to finish as easily as you started.&#42;&#42;</center></p>

<p>ALWAYS COMPLETE EACH EXERCISE, NO MATTER HOW &#145;BADLY&#146 OR &#145;WRONG&#146; IT SEEMS. GET INTO THE HABIT OF FOLLOWING THROUGH, ADJUSTING WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED AS YOU GO, AND STAYING WITH THE SOUND UNTIL AFTER THE EXERCISE HAS BEEN COMPLETED; i.e. THE SILENCE AT THE END IS PART OF THE EXERCISE.</p>
<p> &#42; adapted from the Vocal Function program which was &#147;first described by Barnes and modified by Dr. Joseph Stemple, are &#145;a series of direct, systematic voice manipulations (exercises), similar in theory to physical therapy for the vocal folds, designed to strengthen and balance the laryngeal musculature, and to improve the efficiency of the relationship among airflow, vocal fold vibration, and supraglottic treatment of phonation.&#146; &#148; (Clinical Updates in Voice: Voice Therapy for the Twenty-First Century, Symposium October 24, 1999).</p>
<p>&#42;&#42;Each goal will be achieved in its own good time. It&#146;s not a mark of how good or clever you are; it&#146;s a mark of the health and strength of your vocal folds and your supporting muscles at a given point in time.  These particular goals are directed at full-time professional voice practitioners, such as actors, singers, lawyers, broadcasters and preachers. They are the equivalent of Olympic athletes. They are, indeed, vocal athletes.</p>
