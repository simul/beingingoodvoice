<h1>Articulation</h1>
	
	<p>Articulation, or diction refers to the clarity of your speech. Being able to make fast, accurate movements and placements with the lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates is essential for clear, intelligible speech - in any language, accent or dialect.</p>
	<p>Begin by checking your posture (Stand Easy) and releasing your jaw and tongue.</p>
	<p>Do some tongue stretches, taking the tip down to your chin, and up to your nose, round the back of your teeth (inside the mouth) and pointing it into the sides of your cheeks, first one side and then the other.</p>
	<p>I learnt this exercise in 1992 from Valerii Galendiev, Head Voice Coach for the Maly Drama Theatre of St Petersburg. It involves reciting clearly, effortlessly, only the sounds of the CONSONANTS of the alphabet.</p>
	<p>Here are the letters of the alphabet that represent the consonant sounds you will be working with:
	<p><b>b c d f g h j k l m n p q r s t v w x y z</b></p>
	<p>Remember to distinguish between voiced, and un-voiced sounds. Begin slowly, until you can remember the sequence, and maintain accuracy and clarity. As you speed up, keep the rhythm steady - in other words, try to avoid taking long breaks for breathing.  Remember to Breathe Easy, allowing air to drop in whenever it needs to, rather than trying to continue for a long time, and then gasping for air.</p>
	<p>Follow these instructions, and you will find that you are simultaneously exercising your Articulation, breathing and focus.</p>
