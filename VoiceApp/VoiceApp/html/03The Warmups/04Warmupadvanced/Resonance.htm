<h1>Resonance</h1>

<p>Resonance is the element of sound that gives the voice its range of colours and textures, light and shade. Read the definition of resonance in the glossary for a technical explanation of how the physics of sound shapes and colours your voice.</p>
<p>Everyone has a range of vocal colours at their disposal. The next set of exercises will help you to extend that range, from deep chocolate to light silver and all the colours in between.</p>
<p>Voice is thought motivated, so it is important to engage your intellect, and in particular your imagination.  When you imagine your voice coming from a certain part of your body, your brain and body coordinate the appropriate muscles to give the impression that it is coming from that part of your body. Working in this way involves minimum physical effort, and so there is minimum physical tension.</p>

<p><center><b>The Tower of Sound</b></center></p>
<p>&bull; Check your posture, release your jaw and tongue
<p>&bull; Imagine a large bouncy trampoline deep in the centre of your body, stretched between your navel and the small of your back, just above your pelvis. Picture yourself bouncing on the trampoline, and allow your deepest voice to bounce around with a playful HUH, HUH, HUH! Let the sound boom straight out of your navel.
<p>&bull; <center>TIP: <i>keep your jaw relaxed, and your belly will be relaxed. Keep your throat open and there will be more room in your belly for that very large sound.</i></center></p>
<p>&bull; Imagine the whole of your chest, from waist to collar bone, and from breast bone to spine, is really a large art gallery, and you are the artist calling out to passers-by: HEY! COME ON IN! SEE MY GREAT ART!</p>
 <p><center>TIP: <i>Stay connected to the trampoline. It supports ALL the voices </i></center></p>
<p>&bull;Imagine the area between your collar bone and your cheek bones to be a large schoolroom. You are a young person who isn't sure what is yours, and what is not. The call is MINE. MAYBE NOT. THINE?</p>
<p><center>TIP: <i> Remember the trampoline! Begin the sound with your lips gently touching, but let the sound actually begin in your centre. Get a good hum going, a good buzz on your lips, then gradually open your mouth for the AH that flows into the I and then to the NNNN. Lengthen all of the sounds. </i></center></p>
<p>&bull; Imagine the top of your head, from the cheekbones to the dome of your skull, as a beautiful church with a dome. Here you are a curious child who wants to know: WHY? Begin simply, just asking the question with a light, gentle voice. Gradually extend the sounds and play with the rising and falling tune of the word. It will end up sounding as HHHHOOOOOWWWWAAAAAAAIIIIIIIEEEEEEE </p>
<p><center> TIP: Remember to power the sound from the trampoline in your centre. Always be gentle, never force anything. Be playful, and be brave. </i></center></p>
