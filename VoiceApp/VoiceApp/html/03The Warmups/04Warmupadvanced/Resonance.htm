<h1>Resonance</h1>

<p>Resonance is the element of sound that gives the voice its range of colours and textures, light and shade.</p>
<p>Everyone has a range of vocal colours at their disposal. This set of exercises will help you to extend that range, from deep chocolate to light silver and all the colours in between.</p>
<p>Voice is thought motivated, so it is important to engage your intellect, and in particular your imagination.  When you imagine your voice coming from a certain part of your body, your brain and body coordinate the appropriate muscles to give the impression that it is coming from that part of your body. Working in this way involves minimum physical effort, and so there is minimum physical tension.</p>
