<h1>Resonance</h1>

<p>Resonance is the element of sound that gives the voice its range of colours and textures, light and shade.</p>
<p>Everyone has a range of vocal colours at their disposal. This set of exercises will help you to extend that range, from deep chocolate to light silver and all the colours of the rainbow in between.</p>
	<p>The sounds we are playing with are those that occur in the word "why".
	<p>Explore your resonance range along with your pitch range, you cannot have one without the other. However, you can have deep resonance at the upper end of your pitch range, and high resonance at the lower end of your pitch range, and every combination in between.</p>
<p>Voice is thought motivated, so it is important to engage your intellect, and in particular your imagination. Be creative with your voice and play with the sound. When you stand well and easily, move well and easily, allow your body to breath naturally (easily), you may notice the sensation of vibrations in your body. If this occurs, you have another tool to work with, to help you explore your range and your vocal power. Working in this way (creatively, playfully, mindfully) involves minimum, yet coordinated physical effort, with minimum physical tension.</p>
	<p>For those interested in a more advanced course of training for the voice, there will be modules added to this app. Contact us, or register in the website (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com">
