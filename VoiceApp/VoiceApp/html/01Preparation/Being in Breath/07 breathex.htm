<h1>Breath Exercises</h1>

<p>Always begin each stage of the preparation, the warmup itself, and your training by checking your posture (Stand Easy) and relaxing your jaw. </p>
</p>Practise Being in Your Breath until you are comfortable that your breath flows easily, your shoulders and upper chest stay free and relaxed, and your lower abdominal muscles are the ones supporting your voice.</p>
<p> You can extend these little sequences to challenge your breathing support muscles to work harder, by aiming for 8 seconds, or 12 seconds.  Take it easy. Build up the strength gradually, just as you would at the gym. You wouldn't try to emulate a professional body builder unless you'd worked your way up to it.
<p></p>
<p>Now you are ready to convert all of that breath into sound. It is called &#8212 The Sigh, and it is the first exercise in the Mini Vocal Warmup.
