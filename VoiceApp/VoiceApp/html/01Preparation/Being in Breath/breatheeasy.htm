<h1>Breathe Easy</h1>

<p>This process helps you recreate the circumstances of your natural, autonomous (unconscious) breathing process, but in a state of awareness (mindfulness) so that you can build on it.</p> 
<p>It will feel artificial at first, because it is different to the way we breathe in when we are conscious (aware) of breathing in&#42;.</p>

<p>These exercises will also help you to become aware of how your breath creates sound in a number of different ways. One way is by creating the sound of friction (a hissing sound) as the air is squeezed through a narrow space in your mouth. For example, the F sound is created when the air has to get through and around your teeth, because your top teeth are in contact with your bottom lip, leaving very little space for air to pass through. Another way sound is created is when your vocal folds are drawn parallel, and the air pressure building up beneath them makes them puff apart, causing sound waves &#8212; i.e. voice. Your challenge is to allow the breath to do its own work, while you place your lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates into the appropriate positions, with minimum effort and maximum clarity.</p>
