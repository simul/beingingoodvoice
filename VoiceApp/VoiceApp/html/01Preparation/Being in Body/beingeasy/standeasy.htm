<h1>Stand Easy</h1>

<p>Stand, preferably bare foot, and notice the sensation of your weight through your feet in contact with the floor.</p>

<p><center>Play the audio, as Flloyd talks you through the process of standing easy, and well.</center></p>
<p><center><audio autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" loop="loop" preload="auto" tabindex="0"> <source src="alignment.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> Your
        browser does not support the audio element. </source>
    </audio></center>
</p>
<p>&#8226; Notice, or give attention to how your body feels before you start, and when you finish. There is no &#39;right&#39; or &#39;wrong&#39; response, just awareness. Whatever you observe is interesting.</p>

<p><center>Now you're ready for Moving Easy. </center></p>
