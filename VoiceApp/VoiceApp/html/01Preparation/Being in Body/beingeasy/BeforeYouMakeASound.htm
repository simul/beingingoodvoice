<h1>Before You Make a Sound</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Before you begin to warm up your voice, warm up your whole body. Start bouncing gently on your feet, then hop, move your arms about, jog or dance about for a minute or two.</b></blockquote></p>
<p>Use these exercises to get used to the process of aligning your spine, balancing your whole body in relation to gravity, so that you stand, sit and move with ease. Next, ROLLING DOWN the spine will encourage you to be precise about where your body is relaxed, and where you might be holding tension.</p>
<p>You will gradually become accustomed, WITH FULL AWARENESS, to the physical sensation, from inside your body, of standing well. When you stand with ease, you move with ease and you speak with ease. Being aware of your physical state puts you in control of it.</p>
