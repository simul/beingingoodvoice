<h1>Before You Begin</h1>
<p>Before you make a sound, think about your whole self as the vocal instrument.  Because everything you do affects how you sound.</p>  
<p>Tense or hunched shoulders, crossed ankles, even folded arms impact upon the movement of sound waves in the body. Learning how to be in your body mindfully, consciously aware of how you are standing, sitting or moving about allows you to have a choice. You can choose to stay tense, or you can relax. You can choose to cross your legs, or fold your arms, or you can choose not to.</p> 
<p>When you don&#39;t realise you are doing it, you have no choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Before you begin to warm up your voice, warm up your whole body. Start bouncing gently on your feet, then hop, move your arms about, jog or dance about for a minute or two.</b></blockquote></p>
<p>Use the STAND EASY exercise to get used to the process of aligning your spine, balancing your whole body in relation to gravity, so that you stand, sit and move with ease. Next, MOVE EASY, (rolling down and up the spine) will encourage you to be precise about where your body is relaxed, and where you might be holding tension.</p>
<p>Do these a couple of times a day for a few weeks, and you will gradually become accustomed, WITH FULL AWARENESS, to the physical sensation, from inside your body, of standing well. When you stand with ease, you move with ease and you speak with ease. Being aware of your physical state puts you in control of it.</p>
<p>Standing well, using just enough effort to keep you upright and balanced is good for your general health, as well as your voice.</p>
<p> Standing or sitting with your spine supported also allows your voice to have maximum support.</p>
