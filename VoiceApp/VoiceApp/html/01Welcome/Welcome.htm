<h1>Welcome to the Being in Voice Warmup App</h1>
	
	<p>Working with your voice means working on your expressive and communication skills. To learn about your voice is to learn to express yourself, and to share your thoughts and ideas effectively.</p>
	<p><b>	Voice is an act of generousity</b></p>
	<p>Drawing upon principles for training professional actors and singers, this app provides two basic warmup programs, suitable for both speakers and singers, to warm the voice for general vocal health, and to prepare the voice for extended use, or full training. Do them whenever you can, to tone up your vocal muscles, literally building muscle tone.
	The warmups contain all the elements you need develop in order to begin rehearsing, performing or presenting with a clear, open voice. You will discover how to <b>release</b> your vocal potential, so that you can communicate easily, effectively and powerfully in stressful situations, such as delivering presentations or seminars, acting or singing, public speaking or teaching.</p>
	<p><b>Developing your voice is the only way to improve your speech.</b></p>
	<p> Each set of exercises is provided with audio, talking you through the processes.
	<p>Use the Preparation exercises to train yourself to move and breath easily, to be aware of unnecessary and inappropriate tension in the body that restricts your freedom of movement and therefore reduces the range of tone and colour in your vocal sound.</p>
	<p> Read the How It Works section, to gain a strong understanding of what you are doing with your voice and why warming it up matters.</p>
	<p>Build yourself up to a full-bodied, generous vocal sound, first with the Mini Vocal Warmup, then extending it into the General Vocal Warmup.
	<p> A healthy, well-balanced voice or vocal sound is essential first and foremost, to have a great range of vocal qualities, colours and tones available to be shaped into speech sounds whether you are singing or speaking.
<p>BEING in voice </p>
<p>means being comfortable with your voice and your vocal expression</p>
<p>Being IN voice </p>
<p>means experiencing, with awareness, the physical reality of your own voice as the sound of your self</p>
<p>Being in VOICE </p>
<p>means sharing your thoughts, your ideas and your words by means of a sound, healthy, audible and interesting voice.</p>
<p>&bull;	Your voice is an amazing instrument</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is you, audible</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is your body, imagination and intellect all together at once</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is physical, and your support for your voice is ALL of you, ALL of the time</p>

<p>	Working on your voice is not just working on your whole body, it is working on your whole self</p>
