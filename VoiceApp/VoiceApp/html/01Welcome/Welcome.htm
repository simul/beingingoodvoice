<h1>Welcome to the Being in Voice VoiceApp</h1>
	
	<p>Working with your voice is an art and a craft, not a technical exercise, and therefore it&#146;s about expression, and communication. To learn about your voice is to learn to express, and to share.</p>
	<p><b>	Voice is an act of generousity</b></p>
	<p>Drawing upon principles for training professional actors, this app will help you to <b>release</b> your vocal potential, allowing you to communicate easily, effectively and powerfully in stressful situations, such as presentations, seminars, public speaking or teaching.</p>
	<p><b>Developing your voice is the only way to improve your speech.</b></p>
	<p>Use the Preparation exercises to train yourself to adjust your body as you speak, to be aware of unnecessary and inappropriate tension in the body that may impede your freedom of movement and that certainly reduces the range of tone and colour in your vocal sound.
	<p>Build yourself up to a full-bodied, generous vocal sound, first with the Mini Vocal Warmup, then extending it into the Vocal Maintenance program.
	<p>As your voice grows, you improve your clarity of speech by training the specific organs of articulation (lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates) to be flexible, powerful and agile.
	<p> However, a well-balanced voice, or vocal sound is essential in the first place, to have a great range of vocal qualities, colours and tones available to be shaped into speech sounds.
<p>BEING in voice </p>
<p>means being comfortable with your voice and your vocal expression</p>
<p>Being IN voice </p>
<p>means experiencing, with awareness, the physical reality of your own voice as the sound of your self</p>
<p>Being in VOICE </p>
<p>means sharing your thoughts, your ideas and your words by means of a sound, healthy, audible and interesting voice.</p>
<p>&bull;	Your voice is an amazing instrument</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is you, audible</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is your body, imagination and intellect all together at once</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is physical, and your support for your voice is ALL of you, ALL of the time</p>

<p>	Working on your voice is not just working on your whole body, it is working on your whole self</p>
