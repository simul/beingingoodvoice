<h1>What is Being in Voice?</h1>

<p>BEING in voice </p>
<p>means being comfortable with your voice and your vocal expression</p>
<p>Being IN voice </p>
<p>means experiencing, with awareness, the physical reality of your own voice as the sound of your self</p>
<p>Being in VOICE </p>
<p>means sharing your thoughts, your ideas and your words by means of a sound, healthy, audible and interesting voice.</p>

<p>&bull;	You ARE interesting, so there is no reason why you should not SOUND interesting</p>

<p>&bull;	Working with your voice is an art form, not a technical exercise, and therefore it&#146;s about expression, not about projection. To learn about your voice is to learn to express, not to project</p>

<p>&bull;	Voice is an act of generousity</p> 

<p>&bull;	When you use your voice, you express yourself and, in doing so, you communicate something of yourself to the world beyond yourself. You invite your listener to understand the world the way you see it.  As a performer, you invite the audience into the imaginary world you are helping to create, or to share in the world of ideas you are expressing</p> 

<p>&bull;	Your voice is an amazing instrument</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is you, audible</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is your body, imagination and intellect all together at once</p>

<p>&bull;	Your voice is physical, and your support for your voice is ALL of you, ALL of the time</p>

<p>	Working on your voice is not just working on your whole body, it is working on your whole self</p>
