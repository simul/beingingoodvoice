<h1>Why Voice Matters</h1>

<p>Working on your voice is the only way to improve your speech.</p>

<p>&bull;  Train yourself to adjust your body as you speak, be aware of unnecessary and inappropriate tension
 in the body that may impede your freedom of movement and that certainly reduces the 
 range of tone and colour in your vocal sound.</p>
 
<p>&bull;  Build yourself up to a full-bodied, generous vocal sound, 
first with the Mini Vocal Warmup, then extend it into the Vocal Maintenance program.</p>

<p>&bull;  As your voice grows, you improve your clarity of speech by training the 
specific organs of articulation (lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates) to be flexible, powerful and agile.</p> 

<p>&bull;  However, a well-balanced voice, or vocal sound is essential in the first place, 
to have a great range of vocal qualities, colours and tones available to be shaped into speech sounds.</p>

<p>&bull;  A sound, healthy full-bodied voice expressing clear speech requires an open, 
mobile, relaxed and alert person (i.e. body and mind) â€” not sitting hunched or cramped, 
and keeping your arms and hands free. It also requires clarity of thought. In other words - </p>

<p>know your subject, and </p>
<p>care about it as you share it.</p>
