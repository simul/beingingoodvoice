<h1>Why Voice Matters</h1>
	<p> Your voice is you, audible. When you use your voice, you express yourself and, in doing so, you communicate something of yourself to the world beyond yourself. As a performer or a presenter, you invite your listener to understand the world the way you see it, to share in the world of ideas or imagination you are expressing</p>
	<p>How you sound (the vocal qualities that carry your words) has as much, if not more influence on how your are perceived as the way you look and move.  Your vocal behaviours impact upon your listeners just as body language does - imperceptibly, subtly and profoundly.</p>
	
<p>Working on your voice is the only way to improve your speech.</p>
	<p><i><center>I am my voice</p>
	<p>Where my voice is</p>
	<p>I am</p>
	<p>My voice lives within me</p>
	<p>And without me</p>
	<p>But never without</p>
	<p>Me.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>It sounds before me</p>
	<p>And behind me</p>
	<p>And where I am</p>
	<p>My voice</p>
	<p>Is.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>My voice</p>
	<p>Moving through space and time</p>
	<p>Becomes part of</p>
	<p>You.</p>
	<p>The space of this room</p>
	<p>Bends my sound voice back to me</p>
	<p>As sound gives way to silence.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I am my silence.</p>
	<p>Where my silence is</p>
	<p>I am.</i></center></p>
