<h1>How Breath Works</h1> 
<p>Normal (unconscious, autonomous) breathing happens because the body ALLOWS air to drop into the lungs, and to flow out again, silently, easily, quickly.</p>
<p>It does this all through our lives, without our having to pay any attention to it at all.</p>
<p>The lungs, sheltering within the ribcage, are narrowest at the top, just under the collar bones, and widest at the bottom, resting upon the diaphragm.</p>
<p>The body replenishes the air supply at regular intervals: the rib cage moves outwards and upwards to allow the lungs to expand outwards, and the diaphragm is drawn down by the lower abdominal muscles, to allow the lungs to expand downwards. The lungs are NEVER empty.</p>
<p>If you rest one hand gently over your abdomen, just below the breast bone (sternum) and sit quietly thinking about your heart beat, you will notice at the edge of your attention that your hand is moving slightly because your abdomen is moving slightly.  What you are observing is the displacement of your guts as the diaphragm is lowered to make more room for air in the lower part of your lungs.</p>
<p>When we speak, we breathe for the size of the thought we need, or wish to express.  Again, the body automatically ensures that we have sufficient air to accomplish the task. This leaves us free to think about what we are talking about, to live our lives without concerning ourselves consciously with the essential, life-sustaining  process of breathing..</p>
When we &#34;take&#34; a breath &#8212; i.e. consciously &#8212; we tend to interfere with the natural process. We suck the air in forcefully, and often noisily, using muscular effort that makes us feel we are doing something, but which doesn't actually add to the effectiveness of the breathing process. Lifting the shoulders and the upper chest is wasted effort, and usually results in the rib cage hardly expanding outwards at all, while the lower part of the lungs, which are where they are the biggest, are drawn inwards.</p>
<p>By learning to ALLOW the breath to DROP into the bottom of the lungs, we learn how to recreate the circumstances of normal breathing, but with awareness. Then we can work with the appropriate muscles (intercostals, and the lower abdominal innermost core muscles, in particular the abdominus transversus) to build their power and flexibility so that we can utilize a more powerful, consistent supply of air pressure when we need it for powerful moments of expression.</p>
