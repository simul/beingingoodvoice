<p style="font-family:arial;color:#4F328C;font-size:45px;">
Can you blow bubbles through your lips? Brrrrrr! Or make a trilled R sound Rrrrrrr (like a Scottish, or Italian Rrrrrr)?</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;color:#4F328C;font-size:45px;">
If so, head straight for the audio, and let Flloyd take you through the exercise.  If you struggle with either of these, don't panic!  You can learn how to do them. It just takes time, and patience.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;color:#4F328C;font-size:45px;"> The important thing to remember is that everyone CAN do them, but some people have to work at it.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;color:#4F328C;font-size:45px;"> You can trill up and down on a hum for your warmup, while you continue to practice blowing those bubbles, and rolling (or trilling) those rrrr's.</p>
