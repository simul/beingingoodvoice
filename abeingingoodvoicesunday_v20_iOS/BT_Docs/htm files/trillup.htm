<h1>Ascending Trill</h1>

<p>Can you blow bubbles through your lips? Brrrrrr! Or make a trilled R sound Rrrrrrr (like a Scottish, or Italian Rrrrrr)?</p>
<p><center>Play the audio, as Flloyd talks you through the Ascending Trill.</p>

<audio autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls"preload="auto" tabindex="0"> <source src="TrillUp.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> Your 
browser does not support the audio element. </source></audio></center></p>
<p>If you struggle with either of these, don't panic! You can learn how to do them. It just takes time, and patience.</p>
<p> The important thing to remember is that everyone CAN do them, but some people have to work at it.</p>
<p> You can slide up and down on a hum for your warmup, while you continue to practice blowing those bubbles, and rolling (or trilling) those rrrr's.</p>
