<p>Can you blow bubbles through your lips? Brrrrrr! Or make a trilled R sound Rrrrrrr (like a Scottish, or Italian Rrrrrr)?</p>

the Ascending Trill.

<p>If you struggle with either of these, don't panic! You can learn how to do them. It just takes time, and patience.</p>
<p> The important thing to remember is that everyone CAN do them, but some people have to work at it.</p>
<p> You can trill up and down on a hum for your warmup, while you continue to practice blowing those bubbles, and rolling (or trilling) those rrrr's.</p>
