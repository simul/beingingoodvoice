<h1>The Sigh</h1>


<p>Sighing gently is a great way to release physical tension, and to stimulate blood flow to the vocal folds, literally warming them up.</p>

<p>We sigh when we want something, or when we give up on it. We sigh because we are annoyed, or because we are pleased. A sigh is just air passing through partly closed vocal folds, creating a mixture of friction and vocal sound. But it is also part of our vocal vocabulary. It means something. Always begin to warm up your voice with a few gentle sighs.  Let them mean whatever they mean, just as you experience them. And then, let them go. There&#39;s always plenty more where they came from!</p>
