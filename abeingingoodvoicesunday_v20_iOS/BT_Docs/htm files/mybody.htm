<h1>My Body</h1>

<p>warmed up, aligned and balanced

Before you begin to warm up your voice, warm up your whole body. Start bouncing on your feet, then hop, move your arms about, jog about for a minute or two.<p>

Listen as Flloyd takes you through the process of aligning your spine, balancing your whole self in relation to gravity, so that you stand, sit and move with ease.<p>

Do this a couple of times a day for a few weeks, and you will gradually accustom yourself WITH FULL AWARENESS to the physical sensation, from inside your body, of standing well. When you stand with ease, you move with ease and you speak with ease.<p>
