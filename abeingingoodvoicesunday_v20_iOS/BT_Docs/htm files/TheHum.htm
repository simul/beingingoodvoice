<p>Continue to warm up your voice by humming gently, and smoothly.</p>
<p><center>Play the audio, as Flloyd talks you through</p>
the Hum.</p>
<audio autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls"preload="auto" tabindex="0"> <source src="Hum.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> Your 
browser does not support the audio element. </source></audio></center>
<p>Begin in the middle of your range and slide up and down in pitch, a little higher and a little lower each time.</p>
<p>Be easy, play with the sound. If your voice cracks and wobbles your challenge is to <b>eventually</b> do it smoothly. It takes practice and time for the vocal muscles to become strong and flexible.</p>
<p>Now you're ready to Trill!</p>
