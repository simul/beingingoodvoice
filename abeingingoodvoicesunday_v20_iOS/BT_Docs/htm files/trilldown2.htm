<h1>Descending Trill</h1>
<p>This time, use your bubbling lip trill, or rolling rrrr trill to slide down your range from high to low.</p>
<p><center>Play the audio, as Flloyd takes you through the Descending Trill.</p>
<audio autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls"preload="auto" tabindex="0"> <source src="TrillDown.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> Your 
browser does not support the audio element. </source></audio></center></p>
<p>Don't think you have to mimic my range. Start somewhere that is easily high for you, and keep going down until it's easily low.</p>
<p> Play with the sound, enjoy all those cracks and wobbles that may show up.  Slow down, challenge yourself to see how long you can make it last...</p>
<p>These trilling exercises are for the health of your vocal folds.  Every time you do them, you are working on your voice, building muscle tone so that you can make more sound when you need to, without hurting yourself.</p>
