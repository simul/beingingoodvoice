<h1>Being in Your Body</h1>

<p>Before you make a sound, think about your whole self as the vocal instrument.  Because everything you do affects how you sound.</p>  
<p>Tense or hunched shoulders, crossed ankles, even folded arms impact upon the movement of sound waves in the body.  Learning how to be mindful, or aware of how you stand, sit or move about allows you to have a choice. You can choose to stay tense, or you can relax. When you don't realise you are doing it, you have no choice.
</p>
<p>Before you begin to warm up your voice, warm up your whole body. Start bouncing gently on your feet, then hop, move your arms about, jog or dance about for a minute or two.</p>
<p>Use the POSTURE exercise to get accustomed to the process of aligning your spine, balancing your whole self in relation to gravity, so that you stand, sit and move with ease. The ROLL DOWN (of the spine) will encourage you to be very precise about where your body is relaxed, and where you might be holding tension.</p>
<p>Do these a couple of times a day for a few weeks, and you will gradually accustom yourself WITH FULL AWARENESS to the physical sensation, from inside your body, of standing well. When you stand with ease, you move with ease and you speak with ease. Being aware of your physical state puts you in control of it.</p>
<p>So before you proceed to the voice warmup exercises, take a few moments to pay attention to your posture. Standing well, using just enough effort to keep you upright and balanced is good for your general health, as well as your voice. </p>
<p> Standing or sitting with your spine supported also allows your voice to have maximum support.</p>
