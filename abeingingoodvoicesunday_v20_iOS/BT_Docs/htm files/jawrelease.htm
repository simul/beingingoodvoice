<h1>Jaw Release</h1>

<p>Be kind to your jaw. Itâ€™s been working hard all your life to keep you safe behind its guardrail. Give it a break. Send it to the Bahamas for a rest.  It will thank you for it, eventually.</p>
<p>When your jaw is released, you are able to create more space in the mouth, which allows for a more resonant sound, and it also provides more room for the tongue to be more flexible, and agile.  A relaxed jaw also means relaxed facial, mouth and throat muscles, including the lips and the soft palate, so that they will be in a better position to allow for more accurate placement of the combinations of lips, tongue, teeth, jaw and palates. Your vocal sound will vibrate more freely via a relaxed jaw, and you will have more volume, for no extra effort.</p></p>
<p>Releasing the jaw means actually letting it go, letting it drop down until you can slip 2 fingertips between your teeth without straining. This takes time.</p>
