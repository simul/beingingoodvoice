<h1>What is Voice?</h1>

<p>Voice requires 4 elements:</p>
<p>1:  A want, or a need to express yourself;</p>
<p>2:  Air (breath) inside the body, providing air pressure beneath the vocal folds within the voice box (larynx);</p>
<p>3:  Vocal folds parallel to each other, touching, just enough energy in them to require the air below to push them apart. Vocal pitch* is decided here.</p>
<p>4:  Different spaces and substances of the body to provide resonance. Resonant pitch** is decided here.  It is the combination of vocal pitch and resonant pitch that make up the sound of the voice.</p>
<p>A HEALTHY VOICE is a voice created by air flowing &#8212; not pushed &#8212; between the vocal folds. The flow of air needs to be in the form of a consistent supply of air pressure in the lungs.  The consistency of supply is enabled by the powerful muscles between the ribs, and by deep core muscles in the abdomen, working with the diaphragm.</p>
<p>* Vocal pitch means how high, or low (especially in singing, but also in the tune, or intonation of your voice). Think of how your voice gets higher when you are excited, or lower if you are unhappy.</p>
<p>**Resonant pitch determines the colour, or quality of your voice. Think of a rich, dark, chocolaty voice, or a fine, bright, silvery voice.  You can have them both, or any colour or quality in between.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you speak, sound vibrates throughout your body.  Whatever your body is doing affects how you sound. The more vibrations you create, the more voice you have.</p> 
<p>Sound waves are conducted well by less dense substances. Air, for example, is a great conductor or sound.  Wood is pretty good too. But concrete is not.</p>
<p>The human body is made up of a huge variety of substances, some of them better conductors of sound than others.</p>
<p>Bone is a good conductor, but tensely constricted muscle is very bad.  Floppy muscles are not very good conductors, but engaged muscles are. The more flexible your muscles are, the more space they can create inside your body, and the more full-bodied you will sound. So it is important to understand, and to be responsible for what is going on inside your body.</p>
<p>Tense, or constricted muscles not only limit the vibrations that you can create, and therefore share, they also limit the amount of space you can create in your body. For example, a tense, tight jaw keeps your mouth cavity small, and stops your sound vibrations from flowing freely out into the room to be shared with your listeners.</p>
<p>Tight shoulders, neck and abdomen all contribute to limiting the volume and the quality of the sound.</p>
<p>Your spinal column needs to flow through the centre of your back in its natural curves &#8212; but not overly curved &#8212; so that your rib cage has maximum potential for movement as your lungs expand and contract, and so that your core muscles have optimum room for maneuverability.</p> 
<p>Practise the posture exercise whenever you can.  Do it with awareness, so that you notice whether or not you have your knees soft or locked, whether you have your weight more on one foot than the other. Notice if your shoulders are slumped forwards, or tightened back, and relax them. Make sure your head can move easily from side to side as you gaze out towards the horizon.</p>
<p><b><u>There is no right or wrong. There is only what you observe.  It is the observation that is important.  when you know what you are doing, you can leave it alone, or change it. You have a choice.</b></u></p>
<p>When you have trained yourself to notice any unnecessary tensions in your body, you are in a position to relax them away.  When you know, from the inside out, what it feels like to stand well, balanced and centred, you are able to take that feeling with you into sitting, walking, running, dancing &#8212; living your life.</p>
