<p>Once you are standing, or sitting comfortably yet balanced and well supported, you can begin to observe your breath, as it flows in and out of your body.</p>
<p>Relax your jaw: Drop the mouth open till 2 fingertips can be placed, one on top of the other, between the front teeth.</p>
<p>Allow a silent, quick breath in through your mouth &#8212; wait &#8212; allow it out &#8212; wait </p>
<p>Repeat several times, noticing how easy it is, how you do not need a lot of air to go in each time, and how the air goes in and comes out silently through an open throat. (If your throat gets dry, swallow and refresh it any time you like)</p>
<p>This exercise is help you recreate the circumstances of your natural, autonomous (unconscious) breathing process, but in a state of awareness (mindfulness) so that you can build on it.</p> 
</p>Practise Being in Your Breath until you are comfortable that your breath flows easily, your shoulders and upper chest stay free and relaxed, and your lower abdominal muscles are the ones supporting your voice.</p>
