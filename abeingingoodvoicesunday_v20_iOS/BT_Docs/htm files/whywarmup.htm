<h1>Why Warm Up?</h1>

<p>Voice is how we express ourselves and how we communicate with the rest of the world. </p>
<p>Your voice is an amazing instrument. It is you, audible.</p>
<p>Warming up your voice before you use it is as important as warming up your legs before you go for a run.  It stimulates blood flow to the appropriate muscles so that they can be stretched further, undertake more challenging tasks.  Always warm up your voice before you begin training, and before you speak in public, or at length for any reason.</p>
<p>The Mini Vocal Warmup is a short sequence of exercises for toning up your voice first thing in the morning, and cooling it down at night.</p>
<p>The Mini Vocal Warmup only takes a minute. It's just a warmup, not training.  However, each of the exercises may be expanded, repeated more times, made more challenging until you have created your own individual training program.</p>
<p>Building vocal power and strength takes time, because you are developing muscle tone.  The more you do, the more powerful results you will get.</p>
<p>Use the exercises for regular practice, and as a warmup before you speak publicly, whether you are teaching, acting, making a pitch or presenting a seminar.</p>
<p>Voice work should never be painful.  If you feel you are straining your voice, you are doing too much, too soon, so slow down, take it easy, and enjoy making funny sounds.</p>
<p>Working on your voice means making sounds you don't normally make - at least, not in public! It means taking yourself beyond your comfort zone, challenging yourself.  After all, if you only make the sounds you normally make, how will your voice grow?
