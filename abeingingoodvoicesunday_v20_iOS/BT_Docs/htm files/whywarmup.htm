<h1>Why Warmup?</h1>

<p>Voice is how we express ourselves and how we communicate with the rest of the world. </p>
<p>Your voice is an amazing instrument. It is you, audible.</p>
<p>Warm up your voice before you use it for anything more demanding than casual conversation, like</p>
<p>&#8226;teaching a class</p>
<p>&#8226;presenting a pitch, or a seminar</p>
<p>&#8226;conducting interviews for several hours</p>
<p>It&#39;s as important as warming up your legs before you go for a run.  It stimulates blood flow to the appropriate muscles so that they can be stretched further, undertake more challenging tasks.</p>
<p>A vocal warmup at its most basic is a sequence of exercises for stimulating blood flow to the larynx (voice box) and the vocal folds, toning up your voice .</p>
<p> <b>Always warm up your voice before you begin training, and before you speak in public, or at length for any reason.</b></p>
<p>If you want to</p>
<p>&#8226;develop your voice</p>
<p>&#8226;build its power, flexibility and range,</p>
<p>you need to do more than this.  A thorough vocal warmup includes exercises that warm up your whole body, that draw your mind into clear focus so that you can attend, mindfully, to your practice, and to take that practice into your communication tasks.</p>
<p>The Mini Vocal Warmup in this app only takes a minute to do, once you have learnt it. It&#39;s just a warmup, not training. It is ideal for waking up your voice first thing in the morning, and cooling it down at night. However, each of the exercises may be expanded, repeated more times, made more challenging until you have created your own individual training program.</p>
<p>&#8226;Building vocal power and strength takes time</p>
<p>&#8226;you are developing muscle tone</p>
<p>&#8226;The more you do, the more powerful results you will get.</p>
<p><b>Voice work should never be painful</b>. If you feel you are straining your voice, you are doing too much, too soon, so slow down, take it easy, and enjoy making funny sounds.</p>
<p>Working on your voice means making sounds you don&#39;t normally make - at least, not in public! It means taking yourself beyond your comfort zone, challenging yourself.  After all, if you only make the sounds you normally make, how will your voice grow? The secret to healthy vocal maintenance lies in enjoying the sound of your own voice, and playfully exploring a wide range of sounds &#8212; without strain or pain &#8212; as often as you can.
