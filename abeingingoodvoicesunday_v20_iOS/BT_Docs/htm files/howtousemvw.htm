<p>Practice the exercises on the next screen in sequence: Sigh, Sighing Ah, Hum, Ascending Trill, Descending Trill and Voice Ah.</p>
<p>Once you have learned the sequence, you can repeat it whenever you feel like it. First thing in the morning is good. So is last thing at night.  Under the shower, walking to the bus, doing the dishes &#8212; any time you think of it. </p>
<p>You can also do the exercises separately, whenever you feel like it.  Sighing and humming, as long as you pay attention to your posture and your breath, will keep your vocal folds warm and flexible during the day.</p>
<p>The exercises can form the foundation for a more strenuous warmup, and training program</p>
<p>As long as you pay attention to your posture, and allow your breath to flow with ease, you can begin to extend the exercises, making them last longer, and stretch higher and lower.</p> 
</p>When you are proficient in The Mini Vocal Warmup, you are ready for the Vocal Maintenance Program, which will be released shortly.</p>
