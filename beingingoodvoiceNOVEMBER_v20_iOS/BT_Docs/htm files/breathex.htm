<p>Always begin each stage of the preparation, and the warmup itself, by checking your posture and relaxing your jaw. </p>
<p>Begin your breath work with a wide open mouth, so wide that you can slip two fingertips between your front teeth to measure the appropriate gap. This will feel like a huge stretch at first, but after a while you'll notice that even your shoulders are more relaxed when your jaw is fully relaxed.
<p>Allow a little breath in, silently &#8212; wait &#8212; allow it back out &#8212; wait. (repeat 4 times)
[ Notice how open your throat is, without any effort involved. Notice how the air goes in and comes out easily through the open throat]
<p> Allow a quick, silent breath in &#8212; wait &#8212; keep throat open as you gently allow breath to flow out through the open throat for 4 beats. Repeat 4 times
<p>Allow a quick, silent breath in &#8212; wait &#8212;vocalize the breath for 4 beats at it flows back out. The sound you will make is the central vowel, the schwa, almost like ‘er’ but even more floppy and relaxed. (repeat 4 times).</p>
<p>Repeat several times, noticing how easy it is, how you don't need a lot of air to go in each time, and how the air goes in and comes out silently through an open throat.  (If your throat gets dry, swallow and refresh it any time you like)</p>
<p>This exercise is help you recreate the circumstances of your natural, autonomous (unconscious) breathing process, but in a state of awareness (mindfulness) so that you can build on it.</p> 
<p>Next, allow that quick, silent breath in &#8212; wait &#8212; but this time make an SSS sound as the air flows out. Hold the SSS for 4 beats. Relax. and Repeat 4 times.</p>
<p>Do the same, but this time make a ZZZZ sound for 4 beats. Repeat 4 times.
<p>Notice that you are now making speech sounds. Breath and Voice are as one.
</p>Practise Being in Your Breath until you are comfortable that your breath flows easily, your shoulders and upper chest stay free and relaxed, and your lower abdominal muscles are the ones supporting your voice.</p>
<p> You can extend these little sequences to challenge your breathing support muscles to work harder, but aiming for 8 seconds, or 12 seconds.  Take it easy. Build up the strength gradually, just as you would at the gym. You wouldn't try to emulate a professional body builder unless you've worked your way up to it.
